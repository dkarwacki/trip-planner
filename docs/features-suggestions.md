## Discussion Questions

Which features align best with your vision for the trip planner?

- Should we focus on solo travelers or collaborative planning?
- Is this primarily a discovery tool or a detailed planning tool?
- What's the target use case: weekend trips, week-long vacations, or longer journeys?
- Should we prioritize pre-trip planning or in-trip usage (offline, navigation)?

## Technical Considerations

### Data Model Implications

- **Trips entity** - Need to store trips with metadata (name, dates, collaborators)
- **TripPlaces join table** - Link places to trips with day/order/notes
- **User preferences** - Save settings, favorite types, budget preferences
- **Sharing mechanism** - Public links, user invitations, permissions

### API Requirements

- **Google Maps Directions API** - For route optimization and travel times
- **Weather API** - For weather-based recommendations
- **Currency API** - For budget tracking with conversions
- **Places API enhancements** - Opening hours, price levels (already partially implemented)

### State Management

- Complex state for itinerary builder (drag-drop, reordering)
- Real-time collaboration requires WebSocket or similar
- Offline support needs service worker and IndexedDB

### Performance

- Caching strategies for offline support
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Lazy loading for trip lists and details
