## L FAILING Features

### 9. Restaurants Tab
**Status:** L FAIL - Critical Bug

**Issue:**
- API endpoint `/api/restaurants` returns **404 Not Found**
- Error message displayed: "No attractions found near (48.8575475, 2.3513765)"
- No restaurants loaded despite being in Paris city center

**Evidence:**
- Console error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)`
- Server logs show: `[404] POST /api/restaurants 709ms`
- API was called with correct coordinates

**Expected Behavior (per docs/features.md):**
- Restaurants should load when tab is first opened (lazy loading)
- Should display restaurant cards similar to attractions
- Red markers should appear on map
- Scoring system should apply to restaurants

**Root Cause:**
The `/api/restaurants` endpoint appears to be missing or misconfigured.

## = Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. **Restaurants API 404** - `/api/restaurants` endpoint not found

### Warnings
1. **Deprecated Google Maps API** - Console warning about `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` being deprecated
   - Recommendation: Migrate to `google.maps.places.PlaceAutocompleteElement`
   - Note: 12 months notice will be given before support is discontinued

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix Restaurants API** - Investigate why `/api/restaurants` returns 404
   - Check if the endpoint file exists at `src/pages/api/restaurants.ts`
   - Verify API route configuration
   - Test with same parameters as attractions endpoint

### Medium Priority
1. **Update Google Places API** - Plan migration from deprecated Autocomplete to PlaceAutocompleteElement
2. **Complete Testing** - Test remaining features listed in "Not Tested" section

### Low Priority
1. **Error Messages** - The restaurants error says "No attractions found" but should say "No restaurants found"
