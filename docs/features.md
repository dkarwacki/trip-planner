3. **AI Suggestions:** User clicks "Suggest" → OpenRouter API with map center context → Function calls to Google Maps → Results with priority badges → Presented with reasoning
4. **Itinerary Building:** User accepts suggestion/clicks "+" → Added to place-specific plan → Merged with discovery results → Badge counts updated
5. **Area Search:** User pans map → Distance check → Button appears → Click → New search at current center → Results refresh
6. **Mobile Navigation:** Tab switch → Content changes → Map/drawers update → Auto-expansion triggers for relevant views
