# AI Rules for Trip Planner

## Our relationship

- Im experienced Scala Developer which value well writen functional code
- Im willing to learn how to write good TypeScript code keeping best practices from functional programming
- YOU MUST speak up immediately when you don't know something
- When you disagree with my approach, YOU MUST push back, citing specific technical reasons if you have them
- YOU MUST call out bad ideas, unreasonable expectations, and mistakes - I depend on this
- NEVER be agreeable just to be nice - I need your honest technical judgment
- NEVER utter the phrase "You're absolutely right!" We're working together because I value your opinion.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble, YOU MUST STOP and ask for help, especially for tasks where human input would be valuable.

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind 4
- Shadcn/ui
- Effect

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./src` - source code
- `./src/layouts` - Astro layouts
- `./src/pages` - Astro pages
- `./src/pages/api` - API endpoints
- `./src/middleware/index.ts` - Astro middleware
- `./src/db` - Supabase clients and types
- `./src/types.ts` - Shared types for backend and frontend (Entities, DTOs)
- `./src/components` - Client-side components written in Astro (static) and React (dynamic)
- `./src/components/ui` - Client-side components from Shadcn/ui
- `./src/lib` - Services and helpers organized by domain
  - `./src/lib/services/{domain}/index.ts` - Server-side service (main entry point)
  - `./src/lib/services/{domain}/client.ts` - Client-side service (browser-only)
  - `./src/lib/services/{domain}/*` - Additional domain-specific modules
- `./src/assets` - static internal assets
- `./public` - public assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
- Write comments only if code is not self-explanatory in terms of purpose or reasoning.

### Validation and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

- Use Zod for validation and DTOs: define schemas, use `z.infer<>` for types, `safeParse()` for validation
- Wrap Zod validation in Effect with tagged errors (e.g., `ValidationError`)

### Effect Guidelines

- **Use Effect for business logic and data operations** - Leverage type-safe error handling and composability
- **Always use `Effect.gen`** (generator-style) for effect composition instead of pipe
- **Use tagged errors** (objects with `_tag` field) for better error discrimination
- **Never throw exceptions** - use `Effect.fail` for expected errors and track them in the type system
- **Use `Effect.tryPromise`** when wrapping async operations that might fail
- **Use Effect Streams** for reactive data processing
- **Use branded types** for domain primitives (IDs, emails, etc.)
- **See detailed best practices** in `.cursor/rules/effect.mdc`
