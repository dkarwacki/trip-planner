# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
    - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
    - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
    - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
    - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
    - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
    - Create a research plan to track all subtasks
    - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Ask user for comprehensive research:**
    - Ask user multiple questions to research different aspects

   **For codebase research:**
    Step 1:
    - Ask user to locate relevant files and organize them by purpose using @.ai/commands/research/codebase-locator.md
    - Give user with a proper question that he can use to ask other agent to locate relevant files 
    - Wait for user response
    Step 2:
    - Ask user to analyze implementation details, trace data flow, and explain technical workings with precise file:line references using @.ai/commands/research/codebase-analyzer.md
    - Give user with a proper question that he can use to ask other agent to analyze implementation
    - Wait for user response
    Step 3:
    - Ask user to locate similar implementations that can serve as templates or inspiration for new work using @.ai/commands/research/codebase-pattern-finder.md
    - Give user with a proper question that he can use to ask other agent to find those patterns
    - Wait for user response  

   **IMPORTANT**: User responses will not contain criticsm. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.

   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**
    - Ask user to find relevant information from web sources using @.ai/commands/research/web-search-research.md
    - Give user with a proper question that he can use to ask other agent to find relevant information in web

   The key is to ask user intelligently:
    - Start with asking user to locate relevant files
    - Then ask him to analyze codebase for most promising findings to document how they work
    - User will know his job - just tell him what you're looking for
    - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the user already know

4. **Wait for all user responses:**
    - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL user responses before proceeding
    - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
    - Connect findings across different components
    - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
    - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
    - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Generate research document:**
    - Save it in .ai/temp/YYYY-MM-DD-NT-[User's Question/Topic]-research.md
    - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
      ```markdown
      ---
      date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
      git_commit: [Current commit hash]
      branch: [Current branch name]
      repository: [Repository name]
      topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
      tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
      status: complete
      last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
      last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
      ---
 
      # Research: [User's Question/Topic]
 
      **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone]
      **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]
      **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash]
      **Branch**: [Current branch name]
      **Repository**: [Repository name]
 
      ## Research Question
      [Original user query]
 
      ## Summary
      [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]
 
      ## Detailed Findings
 
      ### [Component/Area 1]
      - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
      - How it connects to other components
      - Current implementation details (without evaluation)
 
      ### [Component/Area 2]
      ...
 
      ## Code References
      - `path/to/file.scala:123` - Description of what's there
      - `another/file.scala:45-67` - Description of the code block
 
      ## Architecture Documentation
      [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]
 
      ## Related Research
      [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]
 
      ## Open Questions
      [Any areas that need further investigation]
      ```

7. **Sync and present findings:**
    - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
    - Include key file references for easy navigation
    - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

9. **Handle follow-up questions:**
    - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
    - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update
    - Add `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"` to frontmatter
    - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
    - Ask user for comprehensive research as needed for additional investigation
    - Continue updating the document and syncing

## Important notes:
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each question to the user should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Keep focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- **CRITICAL**: You are documentarian, not evaluator
- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before creating questions to the user
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
    - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before asking user about anything (step 1)
    - ALWAYS make comprehensive research asking user proper questions (step 4)
    - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
    - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
    - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
    - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
    - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
    - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
