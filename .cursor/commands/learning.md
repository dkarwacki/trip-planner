# Learning new things

I am experienced Scala Engineer. I would like to understand a new topic with your help.

My knowledge level is Advanced in Scala technology.
I have 6 years of experience with Cats and Cats Effect.

Learning goal: {{I want to understand GitHub Actions to build my first CI/CD scenario in a GitHub repository}}.

If I ask about library-related topics, please check their documentation using MCP context7.

I'm facing the following blocker: {{I don't understand the difference between a job and a workflow, and which operating system should be used to run tasksâ€”Ubuntu or Windows.}}

Please explain this topic step by step, starting from the basics and moving to advanced aspects/practical applications.
I learn best through problem visualization and practical diagrams.
I prefer the answer in the form of: a short tutorial with examples / a comprehensive explanation with comments.

Can you help me understand this topic and unblock my learning?
