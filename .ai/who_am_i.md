I am an experienced software engineer with over six years of commercial experience, specializing in backend development with Scala and a strong focus on functional programming. I have deep expertise in Cats, Cats Effect, Fs2, Doobie, and hands-on experience with PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, and Docker. I also have working knowledge of Java, Typescript, SQL, and React. Recently, I started using TypeScript with the Effect library for backend development, aiming to further strengthen my skills while continuing to follow functional programming principles.
