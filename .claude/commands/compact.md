Let's pause for a moment and analyze our conversation so far. I feel that instead of getting closer to a solution, we are starting to go in circles and create more problems than we solve.

I need a detailed, objective summary of our work so far that will help me start a new conversation with a clean context. Focus on specifics, not generalities.

**What works and should be kept:**
Describe all the elements that have been implemented correctly and do not require changes. For each element, explain why it works well and what specific requirement it fulfills.

**Where our approach failed:**
Identify the moments in this conversation when we started going off track. Which implementation decisions turned out to be wrong? Which attempts to fix things made the situation worse instead of better? Be detailed – instead of saying “the code doesn’t work,” describe precisely what behavior we observe, what we expect, and what specific errors occur.

**What we have learned:**
What new information have we discovered during our experiments? Which of the original assumptions turned out to be incomplete or inaccurate? Have any additional requirements or constraints appeared that we did not account for initially?

**Updated problem context:**
Based on all the above conclusions, formulate a complete description of the problem that I should provide in the new conversation. This description should be detailed enough that an independent developer could understand exactly what we are trying to achieve without access to this conversation.
